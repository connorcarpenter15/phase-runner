# Phase Runner

![Phase Runner Title Image](./images/title-image.svg)

## Objective

Complete all levels in order without hitting any obstacles.

## Rules and Controls

Phase Runner controls:

- Press `<space>` to jump onto platforms and avoid obstacles, and
- Hold `<shift>` to temporarily phase through walls

As you use `<shift>`, the power bar at the bottom of the screen will slowly lose
energy. Once the energy bar reaches zero, you can no longer use `<shift>` to
phase. Use your power wisely to complete each level!

## Mechanics

- Player must not move in the x direction
- Background moves horizontally continuously until player dies
- Player moves vertically on space bar press
- Player opacity decreases on shift hold
- Player phases through walls on shift hold
